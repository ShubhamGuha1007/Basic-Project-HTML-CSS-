<b>Some years ago, -new math- took the country's classrooms by storm. Based on the abstract, general style of mathematical exposition favored by research mathematicians, its goal was to teach students not just to manipulate numbers and formulas, but to grasp the underlying mathematical concepts. 
<font color = 00FF32>
<br><BR>The result, at least at first, was a great deal of confusion among teachers, students, and parents. Since then, the negative aspects of -new math- have been eliminated and its positive elements assimilated into classroom instruction.
